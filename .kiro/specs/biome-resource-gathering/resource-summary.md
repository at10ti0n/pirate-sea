# Simplified Biome Resource System

## Core Resource Types (7 Total)

1. **Stone** - Building and construction material
2. **Sand** - Glass-making and fine construction
3. **Wood** - Primary building, fuel, and crafting material
4. **Hay** - Animal feed and thatching material
5. **Ore** - Metal crafting and tool material
6. **Berries** - Food, healing, and preservation
7. **Reeds** - Rope-making and weaving material

## Biome â†’ Resource Mapping

| Biome | Primary Resource (60%) | Secondary Resource (40%) |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Forest** | Wood | Berries |
| **Desert** | Stone | Sand |
| **Mountain** | Stone | Ore |
| **Beach** | Wood (driftwood) | Sand |
| **Jungle** | Wood | Berries |
| **Savanna** | Hay | Wood |
| **Taiga** | Wood | Berries |
| **Tropical** | Wood | Berries |
| **Swamp** | Reeds | Berries |

## Resource Uses & Descriptions

### **Stone**
- **Sources**: Desert (primary), Mountain (primary)
- **Uses**: Building foundations, tools, construction
- **Description**: "Solid rock material for construction"

### **Sand**
- **Sources**: Desert (secondary), Beach (secondary)
- **Uses**: Glass-making, mortar, fine construction
- **Description**: "Fine granular material"

### **Wood**
- **Sources**: Forest (primary), Beach (primary), Jungle (primary), Savanna (secondary), Taiga (primary), Tropical (primary)
- **Uses**: Building, fuel, tools, crafting
- **Description**: "Versatile timber for construction and fuel"

### **Hay**
- **Sources**: Savanna (primary)
- **Uses**: Animal feed, thatching, insulation
- **Description**: "Dried grass and plant material"

### **Ore**
- **Sources**: Mountain (secondary)
- **Uses**: Metal tools, weapons, advanced crafting
- **Description**: "Raw metal ore for smelting"

### **Berries**
- **Sources**: Forest (secondary), Jungle (secondary), Taiga (secondary), Tropical (secondary), Swamp (secondary)
- **Uses**: Food, healing, preservation
- **Description**: "Nutritious fruits and berries"

### **Reeds**
- **Sources**: Swamp (primary)
- **Uses**: Rope-making, baskets, weaving
- **Description**: "Flexible marsh plants for rope and weaving"

## Gathering Mechanics Summary

- **Gather Key**: Press 'G' to attempt gathering
- **Success Rates**: 50-70% base chance depending on biome
- **Quantities**: 1-3 resources per successful gather
- **Depletion**: Locations become less productive with repeated use
- **Regeneration**: 5-15 minutes for full restoration
- **Inventory**: Stackable resources with capacity limits

## Strategic Considerations

### Resource Scarcity
- **Ore**: Only available in mountains (rare)
- **Hay**: Only available in savanna (specialized)
- **Reeds**: Only available in swamps (specialized)

### Resource Abundance
- **Wood**: Available in 6/9 biomes (common)
- **Berries**: Available in 5/9 biomes (common)
- **Stone**: Available in 2/9 biomes (moderate)

### Exploration Incentives
- Players must visit mountains for ore (metal tools)
- Savannas needed for hay (animal-related crafting)
- Swamps required for reeds (rope and weaving)
- Deserts and beaches for sand (glass-making)

This simplified system maintains strategic depth while being easy to understand and implement!
