- Resources persist between game sessions

### Resource Depletion
- Locations become depleted with repeated gathering
- Depleted areas show dimmed resource glyphs
- Wait 5-15 minutes for areas to regenerate
- Different biomes have different regeneration rates

### Gathering Tips
- **Examine First**: Use E key to preview available resources
- **Look for Glyphs**: Resource symbols indicate what you might find
- **Spread Out**: Don't over-harvest single locations
- **Time Management**: Return to depleted areas after they regenerate
- **Ship Limitation**: Cannot gather while aboard your ship

## Advanced Strategies

### Efficient Resource Routes
1. **Forest Circuit**: Wood → Berries → Move to new forest area
2. **Mountain Mining**: Focus on ore-rich areas, supplement with stone
3. **Coastal Sweep**: Beach → Jungle → Tropical for diverse materials
4. **Savanna Specialization**: Focus on hay collection for trading

### Resource Prioritization
- **Essential**: Wood (building), Stone (tools), Berries (food)
- **Valuable**: Ore (advanced crafting), Reeds (specialized items)
- **Abundant**: Sand, Hay (good for bulk trading)

### Inventory Management
- Keep 10-20 of each essential resource
- Stockpile rare materials (Ore, Reeds)
- Use abundant resources for trading opportunities
- Monitor capacity to avoid missing rare finds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"Nothing to gather here"**: You're on ocean or already depleted land
- **"Cannot gather while on ship"**: Disembark first
- **"Inventory full"**: Clear space or use resources
- **Low success rate**: Area may be depleted, try elsewhere

### Maximizing Success
- Fresh locations have higher success rates
- Some biomes are naturally more productive
- Resource glyphs indicate higher chances of specific materials
- Patience pays off - don't spam the gather key

## Resource Uses (Future Features)

While currently resources are collected for their own sake, future updates will include:
- **Crafting System**: Combine resources to create tools and items
- **Trading Posts**: Exchange resources with NPCs at ports
- **Ship Upgrades**: Use materials to improve your vessel
