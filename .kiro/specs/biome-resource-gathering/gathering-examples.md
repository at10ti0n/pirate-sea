# Resource Gathering Examples and Strategies

## Scenario-Based Gathering Examples

### Scenario 1: The New Explorer
**Situation:** Fresh start, empty inventory, need basic materials
**Location:** Starting near a forest biome
**Strategy:**

```
Step 1: Examine the terrain (E key)
- Look for: "This forest contains wood and berries"
- Identify: Tree glyphs (üå≥) and berry glyphs (ü´ê)

Step 2: Initial gathering attempts
- Move to tree glyph, press G
- Expected result: "You gathered 2 Wood"
- Move to berry glyph, press G  
- Expected result: "You gathered 1 Berries"

Step 3: Check inventory (I key)
- Should show: Wood (2), Berries (1)
- Capacity: 3/500 items

Step 4: Expand collection
- Continue gathering from different forest tiles
- Avoid returning to same spots immediately
- Target: 10 Wood, 5 Berries for basic needs
```

**Expected Outcome:** 15-20 minutes of gathering yields starter materials

### Scenario 2: The Efficient Harvester
**Situation:** Experienced player optimizing resource collection
**Location:** Mixed biome area with forest, mountain, and beach
**Strategy:**

```
Route Planning:
Forest (5 minutes) ‚Üí Mountain (10 minutes) ‚Üí Beach (5 minutes) ‚Üí Return

Forest Phase:
- Target wood-heavy areas (tree glyphs)
- Gather 15-20 Wood, 8-10 Berries
- Note depleted areas for later return

Mountain Phase:
- Focus on ore deposits (‚õèÔ∏è glyphs)
- Prioritize ore over stone (higher value)
- Gather 5-8 Ore, 10-15 Stone

Beach Phase:
- Collect driftwood and sand
- Gather 8-10 Wood, 12-15 Sand
- Quick collection before returning inland

Inventory Management:
- Check capacity regularly
- Prioritize rare materials (Ore)
- Use common materials (Sand) for trading
```

**Expected Outcome:** Full resource diversity in 20 minutes

### Scenario 3: The Specialist Collector
**Situation:** Targeting specific rare resources
**Location:** Swamp biome for reeds
**Strategy:**

```
Preparation:
- Clear inventory space (keep only essentials)
- Plan for lower success rates (55% in swamps)
- Bring patience for multiple attempts

Swamp Navigation:
- Look for reed glyphs (üåø) specifically
- Avoid berry areas unless inventory allows
- Focus on marshy, wet-looking areas

Gathering Technique:
- Attempt gathering at reed glyphs
- If unsuccessful, move to adjacent reed area
- Don't spam same location (causes depletion)
- Wait 30 seconds between attempts at same spot

Success Indicators:
- "You gathered 2 Reeds" - Success!
- "Nothing to gather here" - Try different spot
- "This area has been picked clean" - Move on, return later

Target Collection:
- Goal: 20-30 Reeds (rare material)
- Accept: 5-10 Berries as bonus
- Time investment: 30-45 minutes
```

**Expected Outcome:** Substantial rare resource collection

### Scenario 4: The Depletion Manager
**Situation:** Returning to previously harvested areas
**Location:** Previously gathered forest area
**Strategy:**

```
Assessment Phase:
- Examine familiar gathering spots
- Look for dimmed/depleted glyphs
- Check time since last visit (aim for 5+ minutes)

Regeneration Indicators:
- Normal brightness glyphs = Ready to harvest
- Dimmed glyphs = Still depleted, wait longer
- Mixed area = Partial regeneration

Rotation Strategy:
- Harvest regenerated spots first
- Mark mental map of depleted areas
- Plan return route for maximum efficiency
- Leave some areas unharvested for future

Sustainable Gathering:
- Don't exhaust all spots in one session
- Rotate between 3-4 different areas
- Allow 10-15 minutes between area revisits
- Maintain long-term resource availability
```

**Expected Outcome:** Sustainable long-term resource flow

## Advanced Strategies

### The Circuit Runner
**Best for:** Players who want consistent resource flow
**Method:** Establish 4-5 gathering locations in different biomes
**Timing:** Visit each location every 15-20 minutes
**Benefits:** Never face fully depleted areas, diverse resource collection

```
Example Circuit:
Location A (Forest) ‚Üí Location B (Mountain) ‚Üí Location C (Beach) ‚Üí 
Location D (Desert) ‚Üí Location E (Jungle) ‚Üí Return to A

Time per location: 3-5 minutes
Total circuit time: 15-25 minutes
Rest time per location: 60-100 minutes (optimal regeneration)
```

### The Biome Specialist
**Best for:** Players targeting specific resources
**Method:** Master one biome type completely
**Focus:** Learn optimal gathering spots, timing, and patterns
**Benefits:** Maximum efficiency for specific materials

```
Forest Specialist Example:
- Map all tree and berry glyph locations
- Learn regeneration timing (5-8 minutes)
- Identify high-yield vs low-yield spots
- Develop efficient movement patterns
- Achieve 80%+ success rate through experience
```

### The Opportunistic Gatherer
**Best for:** Players who gather while exploring
**Method:** Collect resources during normal gameplay
**Approach:** Never pass resource glyphs without attempting
**Benefits:** Steady accumulation without dedicated gathering time

```
Integration with Exploration:
- Always carry inventory space (keep 50+ slots free)
- Quick gather attempts during travel
- Prioritize rare resources when encountered
- Don't detour for common materials
- Build diverse inventory through natural gameplay
```

## Resource-Specific Strategies

### Wood Collection
**Best Biomes:** Forest, Jungle, Taiga, Tropical
**Optimal Strategy:** Focus on tree glyphs, high success rates
**Timing:** Quick collection, regenerates moderately fast
**Usage:** Most versatile resource, collect liberally

### Stone Gathering
**Best Biomes:** Desert, Mountain, Beach
**Optimal Strategy:** Rocky areas in mountains, desert outcrops
**Timing:** Moderate collection speed, good availability
**Usage:** Construction material, collect in bulk

### Ore Mining
**Best Biomes:** Mountain (primary), some Desert
**Optimal Strategy:** Target ore glyphs specifically, be patient
**Timing:** Slower collection, longer regeneration
**Usage:** Valuable material, prioritize over common resources

### Berry Foraging
**Best Biomes:** Forest, Jungle, Taiga, Tropical, Swamp
**Optimal Strategy:** Berry glyphs in fertile areas
**Timing:** Quick collection, fast regeneration
**Usage:** Food source, collect when convenient

### Reed Harvesting
**Best Biomes:** Swamp (exclusive)
**Optimal Strategy:** Marshy areas, patience required
**Timing:** Challenging collection, unique material
**Usage:** Specialized crafting, worth the effort

### Sand Collection
**Best Biomes:** Desert, Beach
**Optimal Strategy:** Sandy areas, easy to find
**Timing:** Fast collection, abundant resource
**Usage:** Construction filler, good for trading

### Hay Gathering
**Best Biomes:** Savanna (primary)
**Optimal Strategy:** Grassland areas, moderate success
**Timing:** Seasonal availability, plan accordingly
**Usage:** Animal feed, agricultural applications

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

### "I can't find any resources!"
**Likely Causes:**
- On ocean tiles (no land resources)
- In heavily depleted area
- Looking in wrong biome for desired resource

**Solutions:**
- Move to land biomes
- Try different areas
- Use examine (E) to check resource availability
- Wait for regeneration if area was recently harvested

### "My success rate is very low"
**Likely Causes:**
- Area is depleted from recent gathering
- Biome has naturally lower success rate
- Attempting to gather from wrong glyph types

**Solutions:**
- Move to fresh areas
- Target resource-specific glyphs
- Wait for regeneration (5-15 minutes)
- Try different biomes with higher base rates

### "My inventory fills up too quickly"
**Likely Causes:**
- Collecting too many common resources
- Not managing inventory efficiently
- Gathering without clear purpose

**Solutions:**
- Prioritize rare resources (Ore, Reeds)
- Use or trade common materials
- Plan gathering sessions with specific goals
- Leave space for unexpected rare finds

### "Resources aren't regenerating"
**Likely Causes:**
- Not enough time has passed (need 5-15 minutes)
- Continuing to gather from same spots
- Misunderstanding regeneration mechanics

**Solutions:**
- Wait longer between visits to same area
- Rotate between multiple gathering locations
- Check for normal (non-dimmed) glyphs before gathering
- Plan gathering routes with regeneration timing
